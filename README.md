# General-Company-Website
This is an ASP.NET C# website for a company. 
I built it in Visual Studio 2012 and upgraded it to Visual Studio 2015. 

You will know how to CRUD both Sql server db and xml in easy way.
I used LinqToSql for SQL SERVER DB.

I did fix the issues of missing  MukhtarMA.dll and you can download <a href="https://ajaxcontroltoolkit.codeplex.com/">AjaxControlToolkit.dll</a>

Clear code and easy to understand for anyone.
Actuly it's not smart as it's name, but it did give you what you need to build a company website. I buil it 5 years ago.

Good luck.
