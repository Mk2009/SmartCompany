# SmartCompany
This is an asp.net c# website for a company. 
I built it in Visual Studio 2012 and upgrade it to Visual Studio 2015 using ASP.NET CSharp

You will know how to CRUD both Sql server db and xml in easy way.
It use LinqToSql for SQL SERVER DB.

Clear code and easy to understand for anyone.
Actuly it's not smart as it's name, but it did give you what you need to build a company website. I buil it 5 years ago.

Good luck.
